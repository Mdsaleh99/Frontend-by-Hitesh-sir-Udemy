When we want to update entire data then we use PUT request
When we want to update a part of data then we use PATCH request

🔹 useSearchParams
    Used to read query parameters from the URL (after ?).
    Example: /blog?id=10 → get id = 10.

🔹 usePathname
    Used to get the current URL path.
    Example: /dashboard/settings → returns /dashboard/settings.

🔹 useParams
    Used to read dynamic route values from the URL.
    Example: /user/123 → get id = 123.

🔹 useRouter (Next.js)
    Used to navigate between pages programmatically (push, replace, back).
    Also used to control routing logic like redirects after actions.
    Example:
        router.push('/login') → moves user to /login page.


🔹 Server Actions (Next.js)
    Used to run server-side code directly from components or forms (no API route needed).
    Commonly used for form submission, DB updates, auth actions.
    Example idea:
        Form → calls server action → saves data → returns result automatically.


🔹 revalidatePath
    https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/revalidatePath
    Revalidates (refreshes) a specific route/page.
    Use when UI of a page changes after a server action.
    Example: update /posts → revalidatePath('/posts')


🔹 revalidateTag
    https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/revalidateTag
    Revalidates all data cached with the same tag.
    Use when multiple pages depend on the same data.
    Example: update post data → revalidateTag('posts')
Easy rule:
👉 Path = one page
👉 Tag = many related pages


🔹 TanStack Query (React Query)
    Manages server data fetching, caching, and syncing in React apps.
    Automatically handles loading, error, refetch, and background updates.
    Why use it:
        👉 Less useEffect, less manual state, faster & cleaner data handling.


🔹 Query (TanStack Query)
    Used to fetch and read data (GET operations).
    Handles caching, loading, refetching automatically.
    👉 Example use: get users, posts, products
    

🔹 Mutation (TanStack Query)
    Used to change data (POST, PUT, DELETE).
    Triggers updates, refetch, or cache invalidation.
    👉 Example use: create user, update post, delete item

---------------------------------------------------------------

🔹 TanStack Query – Important Functions & Use Cases
    ✅ useQuery
        Fetches read-only server data and caches it.
        Use for GET APIs (users, posts, dashboards).

    ✅ useMutation
        Performs write operations (create, update, delete).
        Use for POST / PUT / DELETE APIs.

    ✅ queryClient.invalidateQueries
        Marks cached data as stale and refetches.
        Use after mutation to refresh related data.

    ✅ queryClient.setQueryData
        Updates cache manually without refetch.
        Use for optimistic UI updates.

    ✅ queryClient.getQueryData
        Reads data directly from cache.
        Use when you need cached data without a request.

    ✅ refetch
        Manually re-fetch query data.
        Use for refresh buttons or manual reloads.

    ✅ enabled (option)
        Controls when a query should run.
        Use for dependent queries (wait for ID/token).

    ✅ staleTime
        Time data is considered fresh.
        Use to reduce unnecessary API calls.

    ✅ cacheTime / gcTime
        How long unused cache stays in memory.
        Use to optimize memory usage.

    ✅ onSuccess / onError
        Run logic after API success or failure.
        Use for toast messages, redirects, logging.

    🔑 Quick Rule
        Query → read data
        Mutation → change data
        invalidateQueries → sync UI
        setQueryData → instant UI update

---------------------------------------------------------------

🔹 Caching (Next.js)
    Stores fetched data or rendered results to avoid re-fetching every time.
    Makes pages faster and cheaper by reusing data.
    👉 Example: fetch(..., { cache: 'force-cache' })


🔹 Hydration (Next.js)
    Hydration is exactly when a server-rendered (static) HTML page “comes alive” and becomes interactive in the browser.
    More clearly:
        Server sends plain HTML (looks complete but no JS behavior)
        Browser loads React JS
        React attaches event listeners + state → page becomes interactive
        One-line definition:
            👉 Hydration = HTML + JavaScript → interactive UI


🔹 What does “HttpOnly cookie” actually mean?
HttpOnly ≠ invisible
It means:
    ❌ JavaScript cannot read it
    ✅ Browser can still see it


🔹 this in Node.js
    Refers to current execution context, not always global.
    In a Node.js module, this ≠ global (it’s usually {}).

🔹 globalThis
    Always refers to the global object.
    Same as global in Node.js.
    👉 Example: globalThis.setTimeout

🔹 this in Browser
    In the browser global scope, this refers to window.
    Inside functions/classes, this depends on how the function is called.

🔹 proxy.ts in Next.js — What to DO & NOT DO

    ✅ What to DO in proxy.ts
        Use it only for request-level concerns (network boundary).
        ✅ Auth checks (JWT, session headers)
        ✅ Rewrite / redirect requests
        ✅ Add or modify headers
        ✅ Block or allow requests
        ✅ Rate-limit / bot protection
        ✅ A/B testing at edge
        ✅ Geo / device based routing
        👉 Think: “Should this happen before the request reaches my app?”

    ❌ What NOT to DO in proxy.ts
        Avoid app logic or heavy work.
        ❌ Database queries
        ❌ Business logic
        ❌ Data fetching for UI
        ❌ Calling internal APIs
        ❌ Complex computation
        ❌ Mutating application state
        ❌ Rendering components
        👉 Think: “Does this belong in Server Actions / Route Handlers instead?”


⚠️ Common Mistake
    ❌ Using proxy.ts like backend middleware
    ✅ Use it like a reverse proxy / firewall
