When we want to update entire data then we use PUT request
When we want to update a part of data then we use PATCH request

🔹 useSearchParams
    Used to read query parameters from the URL (after ?).
    Example: /blog?id=10 → get id = 10.

🔹 usePathname
    Used to get the current URL path.
    Example: /dashboard/settings → returns /dashboard/settings.

🔹 useParams
    Used to read dynamic route values from the URL.
    Example: /user/123 → get id = 123.

🔹 useRouter (Next.js)
    Used to navigate between pages programmatically (push, replace, back).
    Also used to control routing logic like redirects after actions.
    Example:
        router.push('/login') → moves user to /login page.


🔹 Server Actions (Next.js)
    Used to run server-side code directly from components or forms (no API route needed).
    Commonly used for form submission, DB updates, auth actions.
    Example idea:
        Form → calls server action → saves data → returns result automatically.


🔹 revalidatePath
    https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/revalidatePath
    Revalidates (refreshes) a specific route/page.
    Use when UI of a page changes after a server action.
    Example: update /posts → revalidatePath('/posts')


🔹 revalidateTag
    https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/revalidateTag
    Revalidates all data cached with the same tag.
    Use when multiple pages depend on the same data.
    Example: update post data → revalidateTag('posts')
Easy rule:
👉 Path = one page
👉 Tag = many related pages


🔹 TanStack Query (React Query)
    Manages server data fetching, caching, and syncing in React apps.
    Automatically handles loading, error, refetch, and background updates.
    Why use it:
        👉 Less useEffect, less manual state, faster & cleaner data handling.


🔹 Query (TanStack Query)
    Used to fetch and read data (GET operations).
    Handles caching, loading, refetching automatically.
    👉 Example use: get users, posts, products
    

🔹 Mutation (TanStack Query)
    Used to change data (POST, PUT, DELETE).
    Triggers updates, refetch, or cache invalidation.
    👉 Example use: create user, update post, delete item


🔹 Caching (Next.js)
    Stores fetched data or rendered results to avoid re-fetching every time.
    Makes pages faster and cheaper by reusing data.
    👉 Example: fetch(..., { cache: 'force-cache' })


🔹 Hydration (Next.js)
    Hydration is exactly when a server-rendered (static) HTML page “comes alive” and becomes interactive in the browser.
    More clearly:
        Server sends plain HTML (looks complete but no JS behavior)
        Browser loads React JS
        React attaches event listeners + state → page becomes interactive
        One-line definition:
            👉 Hydration = HTML + JavaScript → interactive UI
