1. Static Routes
    These are fixed URLs that never change.
Example:
    /about
    /contact
    ➡️ The file names are static, like:
    app/about/page.tsx


2. Dynamic Routes
These routes change based on a parameter (like user ID or product ID).
Example:
    /user/123 → /user/[id]/page.tsx
    [id] means the value is dynamic.


3. Catch-All Routes
    Used when you want to match any nested path.
Example:
    app/docs/[...slug]/page.tsx
    This will match:
        /docs/a
        /docs/a/b
        /docs/a/b/c
        [...slug] means catch everything after /docs.


4. Route Groups ()
    Used to organize folders without affecting the final URL.
Example:
    app/(marketing)/about/page.tsx
    Still becomes → /about
    The folder name in () is ignored in the URL.


5. Parallel Routes
    Used to show multiple UI segments at the same time, like layouts containing two or more views in parallel.
Good for:
    dashboards
    split screens
    chat + details view
